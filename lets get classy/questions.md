# React Interview Questions and Answers

Here are some common React interview questions along with their simple and easy-to-understand answers:

1. **Why creating the component inside the component is not recommended?**
   - Creating components inside components can lead to readability and maintainability issues. It's better to keep components separate for better code structure and reusability.

2. **What is Formik library used for?**
   - Formik is a library used for managing form state in React applications. It simplifies form handling, validation, and submission.

3. **How can I make the default 404 error page in React Router DOM?**
   - To create a default 404 error page, define a `<Route>` with a path of `"*"` at the end of your `<Switch>` component in React Router DOM.

4. **What is a hook?**
   - A hook in React is a special function that allows you to use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

5. **What is useRouterError and how do I use it?**

   - Client-side routing is a routing mechanism where navigation between pages is handled by the client's browser without making requests to the server.

9. **What is server-side routing?**
   - Server-side routing is a routing mechanism where navigation between pages is handled by the server. It sends back the entire HTML content for each new page request.

10. **What is nested routing?**
    - Nested routing is a routing technique where routes are nested within other routes. It allows better organization of routing logic.

11. **What is an outlet in the React Router DOM?**
    - An outlet refers to the location where the matched component will be rendered based on the current route in React Router DOM.

12. **What is useParams?**
    - `useParams` is a hook provided by React Router DOM to access parameters defined in the URL of the current route.

13. **How to read the URL?**
    - You can read the URL in a React application using the `useParams` hook or `useLocation` hook provided by React Router DOM.

14. **What is Link for linking the URL?**
    - `Link` is a component provided by React Router DOM for creating navigation links in your application. It's used to navigate between different routes without full page reloads.
